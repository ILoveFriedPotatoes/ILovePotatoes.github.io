      The Fried potato is probably one of the most loved type of potato, this type of potato is known as the french fry, or the latke, also one of my favourites. These potatoes are well known for their amazing flavour, and also being one of the most unhealthy types of potatoes in the world, or as people say, in reality fried potatoes are just as unhealthy as any other type  of potato, the only difference is the way that they are prepared and or treated, they are treated with mostly unliking and are being taken advantage of by the big fast food corperations, they make the potatoes into a powder to store for later, they then mold it into the shape of the fry, and then are kept in the fridge as if they didn't care for the health of the potato or the consumers of said potato, this is both blasfomy, and the highest form of insults to the land of the tater, I spit on their shoes. Anyways, the other type of fried potato that I have mentioned is the latke. The latke is a fried potato also refered to in english as a "Potato Pancake", which is about the right description for their appearance, BUT, the taste is something else entirely
