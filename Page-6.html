    <!--This paragraph is to show you of the glory of the Grilled POTATO-->
   <div id=GrilledPotatoes>
    The grilled potato is probably one of the easiest to make out of all of the potatoes that I have mentioned. You wrap it in aluminium foil and throw into the fire, not litterally of coarse, I mean put it on the grill, and just leave it there, you can boil it slightly before but you don't have to.
