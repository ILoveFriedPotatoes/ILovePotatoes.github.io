    <h2>Boiled Potatoes</h2>
<!--This paragraph is just to tell you the glory of the boiled potato-->
    <div id="Boiled_potatoes">
      There are many ways to cook a potato, and probably the most known, and the most hated is the boiled potato, this potato is not only amazing, but also can be molded into greater types of potatoes, for example the mashed potato, which is one of the greatest due to its diversity which I will explain later on. Now that people hate any type of potatoes hurts my soul, but none the less is still fact, no matter what; you can put anything on it and it doesn't have that strong of a taste which is good because you can add anything on it getting is noremal taste with an added mushyness, and an added heavyness which makes you filled a lot easier. If you want to have the full experience of the boiled potato, you can add salt to any extent you would want I would suggestfor you to add 2-3 pinches of salt per potato, if you like the heat a bit more than the bland than tabasco sauce would help with the taste of boiled and salted potatoes.
